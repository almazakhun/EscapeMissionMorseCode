<h1>Escape Mission Morse Code</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
The purpose of the application is to establish and conduct communication with mission control back on Earth to coordinate a rescue. The application will allow users to input messages in English that will be broadcast into space. These messages will be translated to Morse code in the application then sent to the M5 stack to be broadcast. The Morse code messages will be broadcast into space via the LED and Buzzer Module through the M5 stack using Morse code conventions. The M5 stack will also be able to receive incoming morse code broadcasts via photoresistor and microphone sensors. Received Morse code messages will be sent back to application and translated into English for the user.  To use the communicator, the user will have to complete a puzzle where a word will be displayed in morse code, and they must translate it (with the use of a guide sheet) and choose the correct word from the options provided.
